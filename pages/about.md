# **About Me**

Hi, I'm Kanak.<br>
Unlocked a country-locked-second-hand mobile broadband modem in my early teenage, following some crack-the-heck docs.
Been in love with reading documentations to make and break stuffs since then.<br>
Nowadays, I'm an avid enthusiast of **software engineering**, **systems security** and **machine learning**.<br>
Besides coding, reading and implementing research papers, I love consuming books, travelling, illustrating digital art and football(the soccer one).<br>
